recipeInstructions:
  - Wash lentils in hot water until the water runs clear, then soak 30 minutes. Strain.
  - Mince onions and garlic.
  - Sauté onions in oil over moderate heat until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.
  - Add berbere and cook ~3 minutes, stirring, until a thick paste forms. Splash water if needed to prevent scorching.
  - Add Makulaya and the minced garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
  - Add lentils and toss to coat in the spiced paste.
  - Add 4 cups warm water to fully submerge lentils. Bring to a boil, then simmer medium-low, uncovered, 20 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally.
  - Stir in Mekelesha, black pepper, and salt. Remove from heat and rest 5 minutes.
  - Adjust salt. Garnish with sliced jalapeño and serve.
