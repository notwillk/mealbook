recipeInstructions:
  - name: Soak meats
    text: Trim excess fat from carne seca and sausages. Cover with cold water and refrigerate 24 hours, changing the water 3-4 times.
  - name: Soak beans
    text: In a separate bowl, cover black beans with cold water and soak overnight in the refrigerator.
  - name: Parboil meats
    text: Drain meats and beans. Place soaked meats in a large Dutch oven, cover with water, bring to a boil, and boil 20 minutes. Drain and reserve.
  - name: Start beans and beef
    text: In the same pot, combine boiled carne seca, soaked beans, bay leaves, and the half orange. Add 2.5 quarts cold water and bring to a boil; reduce to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook 30 minutes.
  - name: Add sausages and simmer
    text: Add calabresa and paio. Cover and continue simmering, skimming fat as needed, until meats are tender and beans are cooked, about 1.5-2 hours. Remove orange and bay leaves; discard. Remove meats and slice into bite-size pieces.
  - name: Sauté bacon and aromatics
    text: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook bacon until no longer raw, 3-5 minutes. Add onion and garlic; sauté until softened and fragrant, 2-3 minutes.
  - name: Mash beans to thicken
    text: Add a ladleful of cooked beans (without liquid) to the skillet and mash with a fork to release starch; stir to combine.
  - name: Thicken stew
    text: Stir the mashed bean mixture into the pot. Cook over medium heat, uncovered, 10-15 minutes until thickened; add water if too thick.
  - name: Season and finish
    text: Season to taste with salt and pepper. Return sliced meats to the pot and heat through.
  - name: Serve
    text: Serve hot with white rice, sautéed collard greens, farofa, vinaigrette salsa, fried bananas, and orange slices.
