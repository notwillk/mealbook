recipeInstructions:
  - name: Soak beans
    text: Cover beans with cold water by several inches and stir in 1 tablespoon salt. Soak 12 to 24 hours; drain and rinse.
  - name: Cook beans
    text: Combine beans with optional aromatics, herbs, and bay leaf in a large pot; cover with water by several inches, add a generous pinch of salt, and simmer until fully tender, about 45 minutes. Discard aromatics.
  - name: Mix molasses base
    text: In a 2-cup measure, combine molasses, mustard, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. Add reserved bean-cooking liquid to reach 2 cups total; stir to dissolve molasses.
  - name: Preheat and sauté
    text: Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, cook salt pork until fat renders and pork begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add diced onion and cook until very tender and just golden, about 6 minutes. Add beans.
  - name: Combine and bring to simmer
    text: Add the molasses mixture and enough reserved bean-cooking liquid to just barely cover the beans. Bring to a simmer and level the surface.
  - name: Bake
    text: Bake uncovered until beans are extremely tender with a browned crust, about 4 hours. Check 1-2 times per hour, adding bean-cooking liquid (then hot water if needed) to prevent the top beans from drying; stir twice during baking. Stop adding liquid during the last hour unless the level is too low.
  - name: Finish
    text: Remove from oven and stir vigorously to form a thick, glossy glaze. If too dry, add a little boiling water; if too wet, simmer briefly to reduce. Adjust salt and pepper; add a small splash of cider vinegar if desired.
  - name: Hold and reheat
    text: Keep warm to serve. Refrigerate up to 1 week; reheat gently with water as needed to loosen.
